# Note for the grader:
I started coding in js because Poornima said we could use either jquery or js for assignments in an earlier class.  Also there is no mention of using jquery in the grading requirements of the Module 5 Challenge.  You'll notice some jquery towards the end of the assignment.  This is because the TA that helped me with getting the local storage to work could not figure it out in js.

## Description
When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the scheduler.<br>
When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.<br>
When you view the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. <br>
When you click into a timeblock you can enter an event.<br>
When you click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage. <br>
When you refresh the page the saved events persist.<br>
